# provision

This repo is intended for managing my flock of computers through Nix.

## macOS VM (devmac)

1. Ensure that CommandLineTools are installed.
2. Install nix (the non-determinate systems distribution)
3. Clone this repo and cd into it.
4. After cloning the first time on your machine, run:`sudo nix run nix-darwin --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes -- switch --flake ".#devmac"`
If you have made changes to `flake.nix` and need a rebuild, use:
```
nix flake update
darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#devmac
```

## nixOS VM (ephem)

<!-- Basic instructions, see above.

`sudo nix run nix-darwin --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes -- switch --flake ".#ephem"` -->

Ephem is a VMWare Fusion VM. The same instructions as for **devnix** will apply though. Just the machine name has to be changed.

## nixOS VM (devnix)

### Initial steps

Devnix is a parallels guest VM. After starting the nixOS installer through an ISO found [here](https://nixos.org/download/#). Choose the version with the graphical installer.

<!-- Change keyboard mapping if necessary:

```
sudo loadkeys de_CH-latin1
``` -->

*Note*: This keymap is not the *macOS* flavour of the Swiss layout, but rather the classic Swiss layout, cf. [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_Swiss.svg). the `#` can be accessed with `altGR + shift + 3`. Square brackets with `altGR + ü/¨` and curlies with `altGR + ä / $`

Then `cd /etc/nixos/configuration.nix`. Add this to the file:

```nix
nix = {
 package = pkgs.nix;
 settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
};
```

(*for vim as the editor just launch `nix-shell -p vim`*)

And then rebuild your nix with `sudo nixos-rebuild switch
`

<br>

0. Navigate to `/home/nixos`
1. `nix-shell -p git`
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/mystreamer/provision.git`
3. Navigate to this directory.
4. Set `system.stateVersion` in `provision/machines/devnix/default.nix` ot the version in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
5. Run: `nix flake update`
6. Then `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ".#devnix"`

## Bare-metal provisioning

Use an nix-enabled machine to build the iso(-installer) image for the target-hardware.

A simple example how this is done can be found [here](https://coffeeaddict.dev/thinkdifferent/).

*Additional notes*:
+ If your nix-enabled machine (you're building from) does not have the same CPU-architecture, you may use github CI/CD to generate and download the image.
+ You might need to prepend `sudo` to most of the commands in the linked tutorial.
+ If you build the installer-image with flake enabled, you also must enable it when issuing the `nixos-install` command.
    - This goes like this: `sudo nixos-install --option experimental-features "nix-command flakes"`

## Adding your own service

Add the repo of the service to `flake.nix`.

Navigate to `programs/service/git-services.nix` and mkService it. Also make sure that you have the ports correctly set and each of the services has their own unique index (since that will be used to generate the NAT IP-addresses).

## Tipps

If github rate-limits you, generate a personal access token and set it with: `export NIX_CONFIG="access-tokens = github.com=..."`
