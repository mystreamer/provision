This repo is intended for managing my flock of computers through Nix.

## macOS VM (devmac)

1. Ensure that CommandLineTools are installed.
2. Install nix (the non-determinate systems distribution)
3. Clone this repo and cd into it.
4. After cloning the first time on your machine, run:`nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ".#devmac"`
If you have made changes to `flake.nix` and need a rebuild, use:
```
nix flake update
darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#devmac
```

## nixOS VM (devnix)

1. Navigate to this directory.
2. Run: `nix flake update`
3. Then `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ".#devnix"`
